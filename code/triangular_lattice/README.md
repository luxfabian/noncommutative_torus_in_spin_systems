# Skyrmion and vortex lattice in 2D

This folder contains the code which has been used to set up and diagonlize the Hamiltonian which is behind Figure 2 of the manuscript.

In order to use the code, modify the `params` dictionary which can be found in `run.py`. Then runt `python run.py` for the serial version or `mpirun -np X python run.py` for the parallel version
